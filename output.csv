I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.

I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something ""strawberry"" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively ""healthy"" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.",packet gaze secret making european style fresh fruit part make one pie auction church friend requested something strawberry offered make amazing relatively healthy fruit part baking base laying unhooked fresh slice fruit pouring content one packet garden room temperature hold fruit together slice part let beauty arranged fruit show also seen gaze used cheesecake hold fruit stopping place personally like cheesecake rich fruit glazed cheesecake gorgeous admit slice fruit layer cheesecake still springform pan gaze let set remove springform clear layer fruit top cheesecake theory strawberry slice range nice best one ever used thin slice lemon gently pouched sugar syrupy layer br br use base sponge cake baked shallow form base pate sure kind french pantry bit like sugar cook work well flute form also make coffin pan mold layer pie crust even commercial crust work though prefer pate sure hold shape better substantial better club must coffin tie lined pate pop fill fresh fruit ferry great pour gaze people put layer crime patisserie pantry cream like mustard stabilized flour fruit happen think taste br br get baking gaze shelf ingredient began tapioca starch carrageenan dextrose cream tartar locus bean gum looking make began cheesecake use top well use fruit part nut crust base

Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE"">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!",received keurig elite christmas excited break open sample pack pad try different blind favor pad box four green mountain coffee brand never tried anything company research online largest range keurig pad even bought competitor produce coffee brand name br br unfortunately immediately disappointed quality coffee tried dark magic deaf breakfast lend underwhelming say least almost completely set writing green mountain br br one god left midst figured give one last go around forgetting completely glad br br pawtucket lend perfectly pleasing cup coffee nice flavorful without thick pungent unlike blind tried added favored dreamer almost measure caribou lend pad almost standard cup coffee anything new exciting pleasing definitely one better keurig option able test run pad accumulated probably pick box br br know green mountain completely disappointing definitely open trying coffee promotion getting fewer ordered http green mountain coffee golden french coast portion back keurig refers try well see go br br looking choice cup

I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit.

Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!<br /><br />The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.<br /><br />I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.<br /><br />This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again.
